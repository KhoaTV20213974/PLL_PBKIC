## Circuit Architecture

The chosen PLL topology is based on the conventional type II PLL. The block diagram of the PLL is illustrated in Figâ€¦, which includes: a Phase-Frequency Detector, a Charge pump, a Loop Filter, a Voltage controller and a N-Divider. The supposed PLL is designed for the SkyWater 130 nm process and VDD = 3.3V

## Specification Challenges
The main difficulty in designing Progammable PLL is optimizing noise in each block to meet the requirements specification and the FoM of the PLL is approximately -198dB which approach the design spec of the commercial product 

## Test Bench Required For Verifying Circuit Performance
Our team simultion cover mosty DC (DC gain,power consumption,  ), Transient and Noise
